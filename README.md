# Mimosa

Swift wrapper for Sturfee's AI Server.

## Name
I was thinking the other day how great a name Mimosa is. Then I decided
I would name this project after the "smartest plant" because the AI server is
smart. It turns out it is Mimosa Piuka and so that seemed creepy and otherworldly. Hence the name stuck.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Mimosa is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Mimosa"
```
